## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned React Context API instead of having to use Redux. I also learned the dark-mode implementation without having to use Redux for rerendering the data.

### Continued development

I think I'll be focusing more on the context API. I didn't really assimilate all of it. I can write code using it but I didn't fully understand how it works. So, I'll be looking forward to context API.
